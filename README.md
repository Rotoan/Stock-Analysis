# Stock-Analysis

1 Hi-ho-Hi-ho, it's off to work I go! I can't be late, I really shouldn't procrastinate, Hi-ho-Hi-ho-Hi-ho.<br>
2 Created a .xlsm file for the stock data and created a test macro within this.<br>
3 Created labels in output worksheet DQ<br>
4 Created DQ trade volume loop for 2018<br>
5 Cleaned up Readme with line breaks<br>
6 changed endRow to calculate the last row with data, rather than using hardcoding<br>
7 created loop to gather start and end stock price of DQ, then output as yearly price change<br>
8 created subroutine AllStockAnalysis, created column headers as well as stored tickers in both an array and
within a for loop<br>
9 Code stopped working when I tried to nest two loops within AllStockAnalysis(), struggled to fix this until office hours
and only then uploaded.
